PK# Threat Detection Lab – Phase 3: Auth.log Attack Simulation## ObjectiveSimulate failed login attempts and sudo misuse to trigger entries in `/var/log/auth.log`. This demonstrates the system's ability to capture authentication-related activity, supporting detection and audit requirements.---## Step 1: Trigger Failed Login via SSH**Command:**```bashssh fakeuser@localhost```**Expected Output:**```Permission denied, please try again.```**Logged Event:**```Failed password for invalid user fakeuser from 127.0.0.1 port 22 ssh2```**Screenshot:** `FakeUser_SSH_Attempt.png`---## Step 2: Trigger Failed sudo Authentication**Command:**```bashsudo ls```(Then enter an incorrect password twice)**Logged Event:**```pam_unix(sudo:auth): authentication failure```**Screenshot:** `Failed_Sudo_AuthLog.png`---## Step 3: Trigger Valid sudo Command**Command:**```bashsudo whoami```**Logged Event:**```sudo: zakiya : TTY=pts/0 ; PWD=/home/zakiya ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/bin/whoami```**Screenshot:** `Sudo_Success_AuthLog.png`---## Log Review Commands```bashsudo grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.logsudo grep "authentication failure" /var/log/auth.logsudo grep "sudo" /var/log/auth.log```---## Control Mapping – NIST SP 800-53| Control ID | Control Name                | Description                                           || ---------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- || AC-7       | Unsuccessful Login Attempts | Detect and monitor failed authentication attempts     || SI-4       | System Monitoring           | System activity monitoring for security-relevant data |---## Validation SummaryAll simulated attacks were successfully logged in `/var/log/auth.log`. Evidence of failed SSH logins and sudo misuse was captured using `grep` and `tail -f`. Screenshots were saved for documentation and mapped to NIST controls AC-7 and SI-4, supporting RMF and ATO documentation practices.---**Next Step:** Integrate findings into RMF workbook and update GitHub project documentation.
